Project #2

- Food Truck Owner Logs into website
- When an order is fullfilled inputs order ticket number 
- When order is found with customer name and number, user presses button
- Button sends SMS to customer alerting them that their order is complete
- Customer reads text on their phone and approaches FoodTruck Owner to pick order up

User Story: 

- As a user, I want to go to a homepage to see a list of all customers who have placed an order
- As a user, I want to select a customer when the order is fulfilled
- As a user, I want to send an sms text to that user
